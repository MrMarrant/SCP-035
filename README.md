# SCP-035

SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask.

Humanoid subjects of SCP-035, or in visual contact with it, experience a strong urge to put it on. 
When SCP-035 is placed on the face of an individual, an alternate brain wave pattern from SCP-035 overlaps that of the original host, effectively snuffing it out and causing brain death to the subject. 
Subject then claims to be the consciousness contained within SCP-035.

The aim of this addon was to remake the SCP-035 entity in its entirety, but with more immersive effects, in a desire to bring the experience closer to the original.
