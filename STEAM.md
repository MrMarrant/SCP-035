[h2]Features[/h2]
SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask.

Humanoid subjects of SCP-035, or in visual contact with it, experience a strong urge to put it on. 
When SCP-035 is placed on the face of an individual, an alternate brain wave pattern from SCP-035 overlaps that of the original host, effectively snuffing it out and causing brain death to the subject. 
Subject then claims to be the consciousness contained within SCP-035.

The aim of this addon was to remake the SCP-035 entity in its entirety, but with more immersive effects, in a desire to bring the experience closer to the original.

[h3]ENTITY[/h3]

The entity is therefore the porcelain mask,
When a player is close to it, visual effects appear on the screen, a tv static effect, as well as text that should be interpreted as the entity trying to talk to nearby players, there are 5 different variations of this text.

The closer a player stays to the entity, the stronger the visual and sound effects will be, until ... ðŸ™ƒ

However, it's up to the player to pick up the entity by default.
I didn't want to impose that the entity be picked up automatically by the players, to avoid repetitive roleplay scenes, but you can enable it with the convar [b]SCP035_ForcePutMask[/b]

Once collected, the entity disappears and gives the player the SCP-035 SWEP.

[h3]SWEP[/h3]

Once the SWEP has been obtained by a player, an animation will play, showing him putting on the mask with an added visual effect.

Once completed, the player will have the vision of SCP-035 in black and white and a idle sound, and I thought he must have a very different vision of human beings, so I thought, why not after all? 

Once the mask is worn, it will be visible on the player wearing it by other players, directly on his model.

The position of the mask is quite precise on popular models or default models from gmod (like citizen for example) if they have the 'eyes' attachment, it is possible however that the position is less precise if the models have some deficiency on the position of this attachment or when they don't  have it.

With the SWEP, you'll have access to 3 functions:

[b]Primary[/b] (Left Click) :
You freeze the first player in front of you for a few seconds, with a visual and audio effect on the victim.

[b]Secondary[/b] (Right Click) :
You laugh and all the players around you, depending on the value indicated on the [i]SCP035_RadiusLaugh[/i] convar, will look at you and have a visual and audio effect.

[b]Reload[/b] (R Touch) :
You're committing suicide, literally ðŸ’€
